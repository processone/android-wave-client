/**
 * Adapter that assists another adapter in appearing endless.
 * For example, this could be used for an adapter being
 * filled by a set of Web service calls, where each call returns
 * a "page" of data.
 *
 * Subclasses need to be able to return, via getPendingView()
 * a row that can serve as both a placeholder while more data
 * is being appended, and then later an actual row in the
 * result set. You might accomplish this via two widgets
 * in a FrameLayout, only one of which is visible (e.g., an
 * ImageView doing a rotation animation while loading new
 * data, then your regular row).
 *
 * Subclasses will be handed that row View back on rebindPendingView()
 * so they can flip back to normal mode.
 *
 * The actual logic for loading new data should be done in
 * appendInBackground(). This method, as the name suggests,
 * is run in a background thread. It should return true if
 * there might be more data, false otherwise.
 *
 * If your situation is such that you will not know if there
 * is more data until you do some work (e.g., make another
 * Web service call), it is up to you to do something useful
 * with that row returned by getPendingView() to let the user
 * know you are out of data, plus return false from that final
 * call to appendInBackground().
